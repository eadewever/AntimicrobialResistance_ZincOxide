## Abstract


## Scripts (Rstudio)
- <code>1_AST_CombinedHistogramsATB.R</code>: displaying the distribution of the isolates based on their Antimicrobial Susceptibility values (i.e. zone diameter in millimeters)
- <code>2_AST_Pheatmap4</code>: displaying the phenotypic resistance profiles of the isolates using heatmaps
- <code>3_AST_R%ComparisonPerVisit</code>: comparing the resistance profiles in the pre- vs post-withdrawal groups
- <code>4_AST_MDRComparisonPerVisit_PatternsAsso</code>: comparing multi-drug resistance prevalence in the pre- vs post-withdrawal groups
- <code> 5_Fimbriae analysis</code>: comparing the fimbriae expressed in the pre- vs post-withdrawal groups
- <code>6_Additional_picks_heatmaps</code>: displaying the phenotypic resistance profiles of the isolates using heatmaps (additional isolates not considered in the main analysis)
